    <string name="art_title_1">Brazilian long term rentals service QuintoAndar raises $64M Series C</string>
    <string name="art_content_1">There’s quite a bit wrong with real estate in Brazil, according to QuintoAndar founder and CEO Gabriel Braga. Those seeking long term rentals in big Brazilian cities like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are throttled by bureaucratic policies that enforce outrageously expensive deposits, the requirement of local cosigners and sky-high insurance fees. On the supply side, amateur landlords are tunnel visioned on making money from transactions, creating a low quality of service and many wasted hours of apartment hunting for tenants. This is where QuintoAndar, a São Paulo-based rental marketplace, comes in.</string>

    <string name="art_content_2">
        Much of the last couple of decades of innovation has centered around finding ways to get what we want without leaving the sofa.
        So far, online ordering and on-demand delivery have allowed us to largely accomplish this goal. Just point, click and wait. But there’s one catch: Delivery people. We can never all lie around ordering pizzas if someone still has to deliver them.
        Enter robots. In tech-futurist circles, it’s pretty commonplace to hear predictions about how some medley of autonomous vehicles and AI-enabled bots will take over doorstep deliveries in the coming years.</string>

        When Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of Reddit, approached the members-only spirits subscription club Flaviar about bringing an Armenian brandy to market, he saw it as a unique opportunity to honor his paternal heritage.
        “My father’s side all fled during the genocide,” Ohanian told me in an interview.</string>

    <string name="art_title_4">The economics and tradeoffs of ad-funded smart city tech</string>
    <string name="art_content_4">When we talk about “Smart Cities”, we tend to focus on these long-term utopian visions of perfectly clean, efficient, IoT-connected cities that adjust to our environment, our movements, and our every desire. Anyone who spent hours waiting for transit the last time the weather turned south can tell you that we’ve got a long way to go. But before cities can have the snazzy applications that do things like adjust infrastructure based on real-time conditions, cities first need to build out the platform and technology-base that applications can be built on.

    <string name="art_title_6">The battle over the driving experience is heating up and will be won in software</string>
    <string name="art_content_6">Sirius XM’s recent all-stock $3.5-billion purchase of the music-streaming service Pandora  raised a lot of eyebrows. A big question was why Sirius paid so much. Is Pandora’s music library and customer base really worth that amount? The answer is that this was a strategic move by Sirius in a battle that is far bigger than radio. The real battle, which will become much more visible in the coming years, is over the driving experience.People spend a lot of time commuting in their cars. That time is fixed and won’t likely change. </string>
